# CBASS_bleachingdata

Temperature and thermotolerance data collected in Tutuila, American Samoa in August 2019 for Melissa's Master's Thesis. 

In this repo there is:

1. Temp data from field sites (field hobo data)
2. Script to plot temp data from field sites (field hobo temps.r)
3. Data sheet with raw thermotolerance CBASS data including tank, rep #, average red (as calc through matlab image analysis similar to Winters et al), coralwatch color score, PAM  
4. Script to plot thermotolerance CBASS data (physiology_figs.Rmd)
5. Script to analyze thermotolerance CBASS data (physiology_stats.Rmd)
6. Script to compare thermotolerance to temperature profiles (Temp_phys_analysis.Rmd)
